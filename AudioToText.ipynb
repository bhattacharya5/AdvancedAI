            "[07:54.380 --> 08:00.140]  it's a good question I'll come to that this is fine sir at the point where it is transitioning\n",

            "[09:45.020 --> 09:59.580]  get this okay this basically means how the function is changing okay at the second level\n",
            "[09:59.580 --> 10:04.780]  second order change in function okay the first order derivative will tell me the change in\n",

            "[10:10.380 --> 10:17.580]  particular line on the image okay so the second order derivative is here to you\n",
            "[10:20.940 --> 10:29.100]  you take any element okay we can compute that okay so let's say three right so what will happen to\n",
            "[10:29.100 --> 10:36.060]  three I will take right so I will take four I will take two four plus two is six because\n",
            "[10:36.860 --> 10:43.420]  two is f of x plus one for with respect to three here two is x plus one f of x plus one and four\n",
            "[10:43.420 --> 10:49.740]  is f of x minus one so four plus two is six right minus two times of three which is six so that will\n",
            "[10:49.740 --> 11:01.180]  give you zero okay that's all now let's look at these plots at the bottom okay what does they\n",
            "[11:01.180 --> 11:05.900]  try to capture so if you look at the dotted line only which is characterized by this\n",
            "[11:06.540 --> 11:13.580]  in circles blue circles you will see that the first order derivative if I just plot it it is zero zero\n",
            "[11:13.580 --> 11:20.460]  minus one right then minus one it's continuing then again it becomes zero zero right then it\n",
            "[11:20.460 --> 11:28.300]  basically goes to five suddenly then it comes down to zero again and zero okay now if I look at the\n",
            "[11:28.300 --> 11:35.020]  second order derivatives what do I get sorry guys the second order derivative if you look at it\n",
            "[11:36.540 --> 11:42.300]  which is the boxes so somewhere it is overlapping in the beginning zero zero minus one but instead\n",
            "[11:42.300 --> 11:47.180]  of continuing to be zero it becomes sorry continuing to be minus one it becomes zero again\n",
            "[11:47.980 --> 11:54.860]  so zero zero zero then again there is a I'm setting you there with the mouse let me change\n",
            "[11:54.860 --> 12:02.780]  my usage of that okay so then essentially I will get to all zeros then I will again get a plus one\n",

            "[12:12.140 --> 12:18.300]  is instead of being zero like in case of gradient first order gradient the Laplace is I hope this\n",
            "[12:18.300 --> 12:26.620]  is visible to you the Laplace is going to minus five so from plus five I am going to minus five\n",
